# Geant4 B4c-based simulations (thesis code)

This repository contains the Geant4 simulation code used in my thesis. Everything is based on the B4c example.
**Scope:** code only (no data). Build instructions are standard CMake as in Geant4 examples.

## Simulations
- **B4c-single** - single scoring volume
- **B4c-multiple** - nanoparticle grid around a central nanoparticle
- **B4c-macroscopic** - larger scoring volumes

## Requirements
- Geant4 (version used in thesis: v11.0.1), C++17, CMake â‰¥ 3.16
